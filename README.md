# Investigation-with-Python
Investigating web server logs using Python:
A company has enlisted support as a security data analyst. They know that they have suffered an attack on their web server application, however they are unable to diagnose what has happened exactly, or which of their users have caused the attack. The company has provided us with their recent log data records, I have identified the suspicious activities that have occurred in the dataset, using my knowledge and understanding of web application security.
